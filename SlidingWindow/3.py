# 3. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters (Medium)

class Solution:
    def lengthOfLongestSubstring(self, s: str) -> int:
        """
        Intuition:
        Use a sliding window to find the longest substring without repeating characters.
        We expand the window by moving the `right` pointer as long as the character at `right`
        is not already in the current window (`s[left:right]`). If a duplicate is found, we move
        the `left` pointer to shrink the window until the duplicate is removed.
        At each step, we track the length of the current valid window and update the maximum length.

            return 1

        while right < len(s):
